🎮 Human vs AI gameplay (Player "Mr. X" vs AI)

🧠 Unbeatable AI using Minimax algorithm with perfect play

🎨 Modern GUI with dark theme and colorful elements

⚡ Real-time gameplay with smooth turn transitions

✅ Win detection for all possible winning combinations

🤝 Tie detection when the board is full

🔄 Turn indicators with visual feedback

🏆 Winner announcement with colored status messages

The AI will automatically respond with its O mark (green color)

The game continues until:

A player gets 3 marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)

All 9 squares are filled (resulting in a tie)

Use the "New Game" button to play again

Winning Conditions
Horizontal: Rows 1, 2, or 3

Vertical: Columns 1, 2, or 3

Diagonal: Top-left to bottom-right or top-right to bottom-left

AI Algorithm
The AI uses the Minimax algorithm which ensures optimal play:

Perfect Play: The AI will never lose - it will either win or force a tie

Decision Making: Evaluates all possible moves to choose the best one

Difficulty: Impossible to beat (can only win if you make perfect moves)

Technologies Used
Java 17+: Core programming language

Swing GUI Toolkit: For graphical user interface

AWT Layout Managers: BorderLayout, GridLayout, BoxLayout

Minimax Algorithm: For AI decision making
