  * java.awt.*
  * java.awt.event.*
  * java.util.Arrays

GUI COMPONENTS:
- Main Window: JFrame with title "Tic-Tac-Toe"
- Game Grid: 3x3 grid of JButtons (9 buttons total)
- Status Display: JLabel for game status messages
- Control Button: JButton for "New Game" functionality
- Layout Managers: BorderLayout (main), GridLayout (3x3 game grid), BoxLayout (south panel)

VISUAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Background Color: Orange
- Button Colors: Black background with white text
- Player Colors:
  * Human (Mr. X): Red text
  * AI: Green text (RGB: 0,128,0)
- Status Colors:
  * Normal: White text
  * Human Win: Green text
  * AI Win: Red text
  * Tie: Yellow text
- Fonts: Arial, Bold
  * Button Font: Size 40
  * Status Font: Size 25
  * Reset Button Font: Size 25
- Button Dimensions: Preferred size 170x120 pixels
- Window Settings: Non-resizable, centered on screen

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
GAMEPLAY:
- Turn-based: Human vs AI
- Human goes first as "Mr. X"
- AI uses minimax algorithm for perfect play
- Win condition checking for 8 possible patterns
- Tie detection when board is full
- Automatic AI move after human move (200ms delay)

GAME LOGIC:
- Minimax algorithm with recursive implementation
- Score evaluation: AI win=1, Human win=-1, Tie=0
- Optimal move selection for AI
- Board state tracking using String array

EVENT HANDLING:
- Button click events for human moves
- ActionListener for reset functionality
- Timer for delayed AI responses (200ms)
- Disable buttons after game conclusion

STATUS MANAGEMENT:
- Real-time status updates
- Win/tie message display
- Turn indication
- Visual feedback through color changes

RESET FUNCTIONALITY:
- Clear game board
- Reset all buttons to enabled state
- Reset status message to initial state
- Reset colors to default

ALGORITHM REQUIREMENTS:
- Minimax implementation with:
  * Recursive depth-first search
  * Board state evaluation
  * Optimal move selection
  * Score comparison and maximization/minimization
- Win pattern checking for:
  * Rows (3)
  * Columns (3)
  * Diagonals (2)

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or higher
- Graphical display capability
- Minimum screen resolution: 510x600 pixels
- Event Dispatch Thread (EDT) compliance for Swing

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Immediate response to human moves
- AI move within 200ms delay
- Smooth GUI updates
- Efficient minimax algorithm execution

ERROR HANDLING:
- Prevent moves on occupied squares
- Disable moves after game conclusion
- Handle all game states appropriately
- Thread-safe GUI updates

USER INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS:
- Intuitive 3x3 grid layout
- Clear status messages
- Visual distinction between players
- Responsive buttons with hover effects
- Professional appearance with bevel borders

GAME RULES:
- Human: "Mr. X" (plays first)
- AI: "AI" (plays second)
- Standard tic-tac-toe win conditions
- Tie when board is full with no winner
- Perfect AI play (cannot be beaten, only tied)
